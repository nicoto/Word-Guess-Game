    'Exodus': 'Exodus describes the history of the Israelites leaving Egypt after slavery. The book lays a foundational theology in which God reveals his name, his attributes, his redemption, his law and how he is to be worshiped.',
    'Leviticus': 'Leviticus receives its name from the Septuagint (the pre-Christian Greek translation of the Old Testament) and means "concerning the Levites" (the priests of Israel). It serves as a manual of regulations enabling the holy King to set up his earthly throne among the people of his kingdom. It explains how they are to be his holy people and to worship him in a holy manner.',
    'Numbers': 'Numbers relates the story of Israel\'s journey from Mount Sinai to the plains of Moab on the border of Canaan. The book tells of the murmuring and rebellion of God\'s people and of their subsequent judgment.',
    'Deuteronomy': 'Deuteronomy ("repetition of the Law") serves as a reminder to God\'s people about His covenant. The book is a "pause" before Joshua\'s conquest begins and a reminder of what God required.'

    'Ruth': 'The book of Ruth has been called one of the best examples of short narrative ever written. It presents an account of the remnant of true faith and piety in the period of the judges through the fall and restoration of Naomi and her daughter-in-law Ruth (an ancestor of King David and Jesus).',
    '1 Samuel': 'Samuel relates God\'s establishment of a political system in Israel headed by a human king. Through Samuel\'s life, we see the rise of the monarchy and the tragedy of its first king, Saul.',
    '2 Samuel': 'After the failure of King Saul, 2 Samuel depicts David as a true (though imperfect) representative of the ideal theocratic king. Under David\'s rule the Lord caused the nation to prosper, to defeat its enemies, and to realize the fulfillment of His promises.',
    '1 Kings': '1 Kings continues the account of the monarchy in Israel and God\'s involvement through the prophets. After David, his son Solomon ascends the throne of a united kingdom, but this unity only lasts during his reign. The book explores how each subsequent king in Israel and Judah answers God\'s call—or, as often happens, fails to listen.',
    '2 Kings': '2 Kings carries the historical account of Judah and Israel forward. The kings of each nation are judged in light of their obedience to the covenant with God. Ultimately, the people of both nations are exiled for disobedience.',
    '1 Chronicles': 'Just as the author of Kings had organized and interpreted Israel\'s history to address the needs of the exiled community, so the writer of 1 Chronicles wrote for the restored community another history.',

    'Judith': 'The Book of Judith is a deuterocanonical book, included in the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Bibles, but excluded by Jews and Protestants.

    'Song of Solomon': 'In ancient Israel everything human came to expression in words: reverence, gratitude, anger, sorrow, suffering, trust, friendship, commitment. In the Song of Solomon, it is love that finds words–inspired words that disclose its exquisite charm and beauty as one of God\'s choicest gifts.',
    'Wisdom of Solomon': 'It is more an exhortation to pursue wisdom than a collection of wise teachings (as in Proverbs, Sirach, and Ecclesiastes). Its implied author is King Solomon, and its implied audience is the rulers of the earth.',
    'Sirach': 'The Book of the All-Virtuous Wisdom of Yeshua ben Sira, commonly called the Wisdom of Sirach or simply Sirach, and also known as the Book of Ecclesiasticus (abbreviated Ecclus.) or Ben Sira, is a work of ethical teachings, from approximately 200 to 175 BCE, written by the Jewish scribe Ben Sira of Jerusalem, on the inspiration of his father Joshua son of Sirach, sometimes called Jesus son of Sirach or Yeshua ben Eliezer ben Sira.'

    'Haggai': 'Haggai was a prophet who, along with Zechariah, encouraged the returned exiles to rebuild the temple. His prophecies clearly show the consequences of disobedience. When the people give priority to God and his house, they are blessed.',
    'Zechariah': 'Like Jeremiah and Ezekiel, Zechariah was not only a prophet, but also a member of a priestly family. The chief purpose of Zechariah (and Haggai) was to rebuke the people of Judah and to encourage and motivate them to complete the rebuilding of the temple.',
    'Malachi': 'Malachi, whose name means "my messenger," spoke to the Israelites after their return from exile. The theological message of the book can be summed up in one sentence: The Great King will come not only to judge his people, but also to bless and restore them.'

From Corinth, he wrote the longest single letter in the New Testament, which he addressed to God\'s beloved in Rome. Like most New Testament letters, this letter is known by the name of the recipients, the Romans.',
    '1 Corinthians': 'A greeting to "the church of God that is in Corinth," in which he offers thanks for the faith and strength of the Corinthian church. Paul wrote this letter to correct what he saw as erroneous views in the Corinthian church. Several sources informed Paul of conflicts within the church at Corinth: Apollos (Acts 19:1), a letter from the Corinthians, the "household of Chloe", and finally Stephanas and his two friends who had visited Paul (1:11; 16:17)',
    '2 Corinthians': 'The book of 2nd Corinthians is a Pauline Epistle (letter from Paul). The Apostle Paul wrote it about 56 A.D. The key personalities of this book are the Apostle Paul, Timothy, and Titus. Paul wrote this letter to the church in Corinth to defend and protect his Apostleship, and to teach and warn against false teachers who were spreading heresy.',
    'Galatians': 'The book of Galatians is a Pauline Epistle (letter from Paul). It was written by the Apostle Paul about 49 A.D. prior to the Jerusalem Council which had taken place in 50 A.D. This quite possibly could have been Paul’s first letter. The key personalities of this book are the Apostle Paul, Peter, Barnabas, Abraham, Titus, and false teachers. Paul writes this book to deal with the problem of circumcision and Jewish legalism toward Gentile believers.',
    'Ephesians': 'The book of Ephesians is a Prison Epistle (letter written while in prison). Paul wrote it about 60-62 A.D. The key personalities of Ephesians are the Apostle Paul and Tychicus. It was written to encourage believers to walk as fruitful followers of Christ and to serve in unity and love in the midst of persecution.',
    'Philippians': 'The book of Philippians is a Prison Epistle (letter written while in prison). Paul wrote it about 62 A.D. as he anticipated his release from prison. They key personalities are the Apostle Paul, Timothy, Epaphroditus, Euodia, and Syntyche. It was written to show his appreciation and love to the Philippians in a thank-you letter for their continued help and support, and also to encourage their growth.',
    'Colossians': 'The book of Colossians is a Prison Epistle (letter written while in prison). Paul wrote it circa 60-62 A.D. The key personalities include Paul, Timothy, Tychicus, Onesimus, Aristarchus, Mark, and Epaphras. It was written to counter and respond to heretical teachings and encourage believers to serve with fervor and passion. The basic problem was a Judaic-Gnostic heresy that sought to mix Greek philosophy with Christian theology. Gnostic philosophy taught that matter was evil. In order to avoid having their pure god create evil, they had created a system of lesser deities that overflowed from their god. These lesser gods were far enough removed from the pure god that they were able to create the universe (which was composed of evil matter).  They named this lesser deity the Jehovah God of the Hebrews.',
    '1 Thessalonians': 'The book of 1st Thessalonians is a Pauline Epistle (letter from Paul). The Apostle Paul wrote it about 52-54 A.D. and it was one of his earliest written letters.

To encourage and hearten the believers, Paul chose to emphasize the second coming of Jesus Christ. Throughout this letter, Paul focused on the principles of Faith, Hope, and Love.',
    '2 Thessalonians': 'The book of 2nd Thessalonians is a Pauline Epistle (letter from Paul). The Apostle Paul wrote it about 52-54 A.D., several months after his first letter to the church in Thessalonica. The key personalities in this book are the Apostle Paul, Silas, and Timothy. Paul wrote this letter to reemphasize the coming return of Jesus Christ. Some of the people in Thessalonica had thought that Jesus had already returned, this letter was written to correct any misunderstandings.',
    '1 Timothy': 'The book of 1st Timothy is a Pastoral Epistle (letter from Paul to a church leader). The author is Paul who wrote it approximately 62 A.D. The key personalities are the Apostle Paul and Timothy. It was written to give encouragement and leadership guidelines to a young pastor named Timothy at the church in Ephesus.',
    '2 Timothy': 'The book of 2nd Timothy is a Pastoral Epistle (letter from Paul to a church leader). The author is the Apostle Paul who wrote it approximately 67 A.D. and is probably his last letter. After Paul’s release from his first imprisonment in Rome in AD 61 or 62, and after his final missionary journey (probably into Spain), he was again imprisoned under Emperor Nero c. 66-67. The key personalities are Paul, Timothy, Luke, Mark, and many others. Its purpose was to give direction to Timothy and urge him to visit one final time. From the somber nature of this letter, it is apparent that Paul knew that his work was done and that his life was nearly at an end (4:6-8).',
    'Titus': 'The book of Titus is a Pastoral Epistle (letter from Paul to a church leader). The author is Paul who wrote it approximately 66 A.D. Key personalities include Paul and Titus. It was written to guide Titus, a Greek believer, in his leadership of the churches on the island of Crete, “For this reason I left you in Crete, that you would set in order what remains and appoint elders in every city as I directed you” (1:5). As was the case with the letter of 1st Timothy, Paul writes to encourage and guide young pastors in dealing with opposition from both false teachers and the sinful nature of men.',
    'Philemon': 'The book of Philemon is a Prison Epistle (letter written while in prison), which Paul wrote circa 61 A.D. The key personalities of Philemon are Paul, Philemon, and Onesimus. It was written to Philemon as a plea to request forgiveness for his runaway servant Onesimus, who was a new believer in Jesus Christ. The book of Philemon consists of only one chapter.',
    'Hebrews': 'The book of Hebrews is a General Epistle (Apostolic Letter). It was written mainly to the Hebrew believers. The author is anonymous, although either Paul or Barnabas was traditionally accepted as the author. It was written approximately 67 A.D. Its purpose was to present the Lord Jesus Christ as perfect and superior in comparison to anything Judaism and the old covenant had to offer. The author was writing to a group of Christians who were under intense persecution and some were contemplating a return to Judaism. He admonished them not to turn away from their only hope of salvation.'

It was likely the first New Testament book (letter) to be written. The key personalities of this book are James and Persecuted Christians. The apostle wrote this book to Jewish believers to encourage them to endure and live bold Christian lives. This is a book about practical Christian living that reflects a genuine faith that transforms lives. In many ways, it is similar to the OT book of Proverbs.',

    '1 John': 'This book of the Bible is a General Epistle (Apostolic Letter). It is written by the Disciple/Apostle John around 85-95 A.D. probably from Ephesus. The key personalities are the Apostles Peter and Paul. Its purpose was to warn about the increasing threat of false teachings and to reassure Christians of their faith and love in Jesus Christ. It was written to combat false teachings that had to do with the denial that Jesus had a genuine human body (1:1). This Gnostic view of matter as being evil led to two responses, asceticism or licentiousness. He very clearly writes to give the true tests of a true Christian. These tests also contradicted the Gnostic licentious approach to Christianity. He gives several means to measure the reality of one’s conversion experience.',
    '2 John': 'This book of the Bible is a General Epistle (Apostolic Letter). It is written by the Disciple/Apostle John around 85-95 A.D. Key personality is John. It was written to encourage all Christians not to lose focus of Jesus Christ and to warn against persistent heresy. His key purpose is that his children (the children of God) may abide in the truth and the truth may abide in them.',
    '3 John': 'This book of the Bible is a General Epistle (Apostolic Letter). It is written by the Disciple/Apostle John around 85-95 A.D.

Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.
Display the following on the page:
Press any key to get started!
Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).

If the word is madonna, display it like this when the game starts: _ _ _ _ _ _ _.
As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: m a d o _  _ a.

Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).
Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like L Z Y H).
After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.

Word Guess Game Bonuses

Play a sound or song when the user guesses their word correctly, like in our demo.
Write some stylish CSS rules to make a design that fits your game's theme.

HARD MODE: Organize your game code as an object, except for the key events to get the letter guessed. This will be a challenge if you haven't coded with JavaScript before, but we encourage anyone already familiar with the language to try this out.
Save your whole game and its properties in an object.
Save any of your game's functions as methods, and call them underneath your object declaration using event listeners.
Don't forget to place your global variables and functions above your object.

Remember: global variables, then objects, then calls.

Definitely talk with a TA or your instructor if you get tripped up during this challenge.

A Few Tips

IMPORTANT: Whichever assignment you choose, code your game one piece at a time! Code all of your apps one piece at a time. Always code one piece at a time!

Pseudocode your program and break the app down into tiny, manageable fragments. This will make the coding process much less frustrating and a veritable Mach number faster. Otherwise, you'll be chipping away at a giant chunk of abstraction for way too many hours.

The ability to solve a large problem by treating it as a set of smaller ones is the hallmark of a strong programmer. Best start adapting this into your development routine now, to better prepare for your more complex future projects.
Remember:

Split the whole program into many distinct, pseudocoded problems.
Focus on one of the smaller problems and solve it.
Only when you solve one problem should you then move onto your next problem.

When you encounter bugs (and we all do), console.log will become your best friend. Regularly check your console to make sure your app is spitting out the right values.

As a more advanced—but more powerful—alternative, feel free to experiment with the Chrome DevTools Debugger.

Try your best to deliver a 'working/playable game' by the end of the deadline. If you're not making progress with Word Guess, switch gears to the Psychic game. Contact your TA/Instructor if you're not making progress after 2 hours. We're here to help!
Substance over style! Submitting a working game matters more that making a broken app that at least looks pretty. We're focusing on game mechanics, not just on the look and feel of your app.
That said, coding a functional app that also looks pretty would be impressive.
Always commit your work and back it up with GitHub pushes. You don't want to lose hours of your work because you didn't push it to GitHub every half hour or so.

Commit often.

Turn in anything you have! Even if you don't finish, we still want to see what you were able to accomplish in the time we gave you. This will help us know what concepts we could help you with, as well as what topics we should focus on in the coming lectures.

Reminder: Submission on BCS

Please submit both the deployed Github.io link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!
